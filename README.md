# Cards Of Valhalla Narrative Game AI Generative
Project created to deliver the AI ​​course for DIO Devs with Santander

## 📒 Description
Imagine if independent developers could create narrative games with movie aesthetics, like FMV games. How many new and creative stories and adventures would arise in this game genre! I developed this project to explore this possibility. This is just the trailer; the game is being developed in Unity and will have a mix of narrative mechanics and path choices with scenes that show the events, in addition to card game mechanics, used to simulate and control battles, giving greater power to the player's hands.
This teaser refers to an experimental project that studies the use of generative AIs and intelligent systems in general in game development. This is also part of an exercise delivered in the AI ​​for Devs course.

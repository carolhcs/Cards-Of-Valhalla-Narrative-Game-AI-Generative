## üìí Description
Imagine if independent developers could create narrative games with movie aesthetics, like FMV games. How many new and creative stories and adventures would arise in this game genre! I developed this project to explore this possibility. This is just the trailer; the game is being developed in Unity and will have a mix of narrative mechanics and path choices with scenes that show the events, in addition to card game mechanics, used to simulate and control battles, giving greater power to the player's hands.
This teaser refers to an experimental project that studies the use of generative AIs and intelligent systems in general in game development. This is also part of an exercise delivered in the AI ‚Äã‚Äãfor Devs course.

## ü§ñ Technologies Used
Tools used to create the Teaser:
- [Haiper](https://haiper.ai/)
- [Suno](https://suno.com)
- [ElevenLabs](https://elevenlabs.io)
- [Capcut](https://www.capcut.com)
- [Leonardo.AI](https://app.leonardo.ai)
- [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/chatgpt/)

## üßê Creation process
The initial idea for the project and the game came about while I was working on an assignment for another course, a specialization in Game Design. I wrote the document and started the development of this project as part of the course submission, and I decided to use generative AI tools as part of the study and experimentation.

The idea was to create a prototype and a study on ways to use new generative AI tools in the development of game prototypes more quickly and at a lower cost for validation. This would even enable independent developers, without financial backing, to develop their ideas with presentable quality for their audience or even for publishers. This is a study that I have been doing on my own.

When the requirement for this assignment came up in the DIO course, I had the idea to create a teaser for my game project. In this way, I defined the tools and selected the key scene ideas from the game's story to present in the teaser.

With all the notes taken, I started generating the scenes in the Haiper tool. I selected the best scenes that best fit with the others and with the game's context, and began assembling them in the CapCut tool. The background music was made with the Suno tool and was already ready beforehand, as it had already been made for the game. After that, I generated some sound effects and sourced others from public domain (CC0) download sites. Finally, I decided to generate some dialogue presented throughout the teaser by characters from the story, to help contextualize what was being presented. I used ElevenLabs to generate the voices. To finalize, I used Leonardo.AI to create the game logo image shown at the end of the teaser. I assembled and organized everything within CapCut, and you can view the result [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3ecKrBqTdY).
